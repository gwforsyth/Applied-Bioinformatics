Part 1 files:

parse_align2.py is the parse file to extract the data from the ig_pairs and serprot pairs file.
The input and output files were changed accordingly. 
serprot_parsed.txt is the result of the parse file for the serprot pairs.
The corresponding file for ig-pairs was too large to upload to github.
