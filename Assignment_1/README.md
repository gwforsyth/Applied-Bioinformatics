Part 1 - Ring Buffer

ring_buffer.py - A script which creates the ring buffer using the data in signal.txt and stores the smoothed data in smoothed.txt

plot_graph60.txt - A text file which contains the commands used in R to plot the graph

graph60.pdf - A graph displaying the results for the ring buffer.  The graph was used to find the optimum size for the buffer.  60 was the chosen size since its graph had the least noise and the most defined curve.  It was also noticed that the graph was very similar to a sine graph.

Part 2 - Biopython

NC_002695.fasta - The fasta file for the E.coli 0157 genome obtained from the GEO website

record_lengths.py - A script used to find the three longest sequences and prints the results into longest_genes.fasta
